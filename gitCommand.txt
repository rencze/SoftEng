✅ Check which files changed
1️⃣ git status

Git will show modified, added, or deleted files.
Only staged files will be included in the commit.
 Stage the files you want to commit
To stage all changes:

2️⃣git add .

✅ Check which files changed
To stage specific files only (safer):
git add backend/server.js frontend/src/app/page.js

 Commit your changes
3️⃣git commit -m "Describe what you changed"


Use a short, clear description of what you edited or added.

 Push to GitHub
4️⃣git push


Since your main branch is already tracking origin/main, this will upload all committed changes.
No need to use -u again after the first push.
💡 Tip: Always check git status before committing to make sure you’re only committing what you want.

Do you want me to do that?


let’s break it down really clearly.

1 What is git commit -m "message"?
1️⃣git commit = “Take a snapshot of my project right now and save it in Git’s history.”
-m "message" = “Give a short description of what I changed in this snapshot.”
Think of it like taking a photo of your project, and the message is the label on the photo.

2️⃣ Does it change files?
No. The commit doesn’t edit or change your files.
It only records changes you’ve already staged with git add.

Example:
You edit README.md or server.js.
You run:
git add README.md server.js

Now Git is aware of your changes.
Then you run:
git commit -m "Updated README and server.js"
Git saves this snapshot.
Your files themselves don’t change — you just recorded the edits.

3️⃣ After commit, push to GitHub
git push
This uploads your committed snapshot to GitHub.
Now the changes are live online.

✅ Key idea:
git add = “Stage these files for saving”
git commit = “Save a snapshot of the staged files in Git”
git push = “Upload the saved snapshot to GitHub”


File/Folder Colors in VS Code (Git mode)
Green
Meaning: Newly added files that are staged (ready to be committed).
Example: You just created a file and ran git add file.txt.

Light Green (or bright green text)
Meaning: New files not staged yet (untracked).
Example: You created a file but haven’t run git add on it.

Blue
Meaning: Modified files not staged yet.
Example: You edited an existing file but haven’t staged it.

Orange / Yellow
Meaning: Modified files that are staged.
Example: You edited a file and ran git add, but haven’t committed yet.

Red
Meaning: Deleted files (tracked by Git, removed from folder).
Example: You deleted a file, but the change hasn’t been committed yet.

Purple / Gray
Meaning: Ignored files (listed in .gitignore) or files outside Git.
