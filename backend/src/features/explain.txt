1️⃣ auth.controller.js and auth.routes.js

Purpose: Handle authentication (login/register).

What it does:

register → create a new user in the database

login → validate username/password and return a JWT

Routes example:

POST /api/auth/register
POST /api/auth/login


Why it exists: Authentication is separate from other user functionality. Think of it as “how users get into the system.”

2️⃣ users.controller.js and users.routes.js

Purpose: Handle user-related actions after login.

What it does:

getProfile → get info about the logged-in user

adminOnly → routes restricted by role (Owner, Technician, etc.)

Routes example:

GET /api/users/profile      → any logged-in user
GET /api/users/admin        → only Owner (roleId = 2)


Why it exists: Once users are logged in, you may want other features: profile, edit info, list users, delete users, etc.

Key point: auth is for authentication, users is for user management and protected actions.

3️⃣ Why separate them?

Separation of concerns: Auth handles login/register. Users handle all other actions.

Easier to maintain when the app grows. You don’t want your login logic mixed with profile, admin, or CRUD actions.

Makes routes, controllers, and middleware cleaner.

✅ Summary:

Feature	Controller	Routes	Purpose
auth	auth.controller	auth.routes	Register/login, issue JWT
users	users.controller	users.routes	Get profile, role-based routes, CRUD actions
