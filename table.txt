üîπ Option 2: Technician via Management Page (Recommended)

üëâ User first registers as a normal user (Customer) ‚Üí then the Owner/Admin decides to promote them into a Technician using a management page.
‚úÖ Pros
More control (only verified/approved users become technicians).
Matches real workflow (usually owners approve technicians).
Cleaner separation between user registration and role management.
You can collect technician details (certs, documents, schedules) in one place.

‚ùå Cons

Slightly more work to set up (need a Technician Management page).

Technicians can‚Äôt self-register immediately ‚Äî they must wait for approval.
üëâ For your system:
users ‚úÖ keep (already there)
technicians ‚úÖ keep (technician added/removed)
schedules ‚úÖ keep (shift changes matter)
bookings ‚úÖ keep (audit trail of customer activity)

roles ‚ùå skip (static data)
    
    CREATE TABLE technicians (
    technicianId INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    userId INT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    createdAt TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updatedAt TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (userId) REFERENCES users(userId) ON DELETE CASCADE
);


CREATE TABLE schedules (
    scheduleId INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    technicianId INT NOT NULL,
    workDate DATE NOT NULL,
    createdAt TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updatedAt TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (technicianId) REFERENCES technicians(technicianId) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

CREATE TABLE timeSlots (
    timeSlotId INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    scheduleId INT NOT NULL,
    startTime TIME NOT NULL,
    endTime TIME NOT NULL,
    isAvailable TINYINT(1) DEFAULT 1, -- 1 = free, 0 = booked
    FOREIGN KEY (scheduleId) REFERENCES schedules(scheduleId) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

üîπ Example Workflow

Technician sets availability for Sept 10, 2025:

INSERT INTO schedules (technicianId, workDate) 
VALUES (1, '2025-09-10');


System (or Owner) generates slots for that day:

INSERT INTO timeSlots (scheduleId, startTime, endTime)
VALUES 
  (1, '09:00:00', '10:00:00'),
  (1, '10:00:00', '11:00:00'),
  (1, '11:00:00', '12:00:00');


Customer books 10‚Äì11am slot ‚Üí mark as booked:

UPDATE timeSlots 
SET isAvailable = 0 
WHERE timeSlotId = 2;
